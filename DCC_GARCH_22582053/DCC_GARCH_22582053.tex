\section{\texorpdfstring{Introduction
\label{Introduction}}{Introduction }}\label{introduction}}

When dealing with financial markets and portfolio creation it is
paramount for an investor or risk managers to understand the risk
involved in their investment decisions. Within financial markets,
volatility is often evaluated as a measure of uncertainty and risk.
Thus, through evaluating the volatility structure of indexes we are able
to understand the risk structure involved with certain investment
decisions. Furthermore, by evaluating the dynamic correlations between
indexes we are able to better diversify a portfolio and reduce risk. The
main objective of this project is to understand the multivariate
volatility structure of local equities and thus understand the relative
risk associated with certain investment decisions.

The use of Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) GARCH models to
evaluate market dynamics and dynamic correlations has become more
frequent in portfolio creation and financial theory. Boudt, Danielsson
\& Laurent (\protect\hyperlink{ref-boudt2013robust}{2013}) make use of
an extension of a DCC GARCH model to forecasting the covariance matrix
of the daily EUR/USD and Yen/USD return series
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-boudt2013robust}{Boudt \emph{et al.}, 2013}).
Additionally, Shiferaw (\protect\hyperlink{ref-shiferaw2019time}{2019})
run a multivariate DCC-GARCH model to evaluate time varying correlation
between energy price dynamics and agricultural commodity to name a few
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-shiferaw2019time}{Shiferaw, 2019}).

Understanding this topic can be vitally important for investors and
portfolio managers when making investment decisions. Realizing the risk
exposure a portfolio is inherently exposed to is crucial when making
investment decisions. Thus, by modeling the volatility of local equities
an investor can make more informed investment decisions based on the
intended level of risk the investors wants to take on. This project aims
to achieve this analysis through a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)
GARCH model capturing the market dynamics and volatility structures of
local sectors and indexes. This model is renowned for its proficiency in
assessing multivariate time series data, particularly its capability to
capture the evolving correlations between different financial time
series.

The results of this study find the Resource sector to be the most
volatile with the ALSI and Industrial sector being the least volatile.

The remainder of this paper is ordered as follows: The next section
covers the Data and Methodology, followed by the Results section,
followed by the discussion section and lastly the Conclusion.

\hypertarget{data-methodology}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Data Methodology
\label{Data Methodology}}{Data Methodology }}\label{data-methodology}}

Throughout this paper multivariate volatility modeling techniques will
be used with the focus on understanding the dynamic relationships and
co-movements of volatility across multiple sectors/indexes within the
local equities market.

Of the MV-volatility modeling techniques that there are available, I
will be utilizing the DCC-GARCH model. My aim is to use DCC models in
the multivariate volatility analysis as these models are simpler and
relax the constraint of a fixed correlation structure which is assumed
by the CCC model, which allows for estimates of time varying
correlation. I will be conducting the DCC-GARCH volatility model in R
statistical package.

The data I am using holds the returns for the following indexes/sectors,
ALSI, Financial Sector, Industrial Sector, jsapy index and the Resource
Sector.

\hypertarget{variation-in-index-returns}{%
\subsection{Variation in index
returns}\label{variation-in-index-returns}}

Figure \ref{Figure1} below plots the time series analysis of each
indexes returns. The importance of this plot for this analysis lies in
it's ability to portray the variance structure in each indexes returns.
By visualizing the return structure of an index through time we are able
to identify the most volatile and thus more risky indexes.

While holding the y-axis fixed, figure \ref{Figure1} shows that the most
volatile index/sector is that of the Resource sector. While the ALSI and
Industrial sector appear to be the least volatile and thus lowest risk
investment opportunities.

To further evaluate the return structure of the indexes/sectors in
question figure \ref{Figure2} analyses the distribution of returns
through a histogram plot.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{DCC_GARCH_22582053_files/figure-latex/Figure1-1} 

}

\caption{Time Series Analysis of Returns \label{Figure1}}\label{fig:Figure1}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{analyzing-the-distribution-of-returns}{%
\subsection{Analyzing the Distribution of
Returns}\label{analyzing-the-distribution-of-returns}}

Through figure \ref{Figure1} we have identified the resource sector as
the most volatile and thus most risky investment option, while the ALSI
and industrial sector to be the least volatile. To build on this
analysis I run a histogram plot of the return structure. Through this
plot we are able to identify any fat tails or skewness in returns as
well as identify the index/sector with the widest variation in returns.

The results of figure \ref{Figure2} below are inline with that found in
figure \ref{Figure1} above. The resource sector once again appears to be
the most volatile with the ALSI and industrial sector appearing to be
the least volatile.

Following the analysis of figures \ref{Figure1} and \ref{Figure2} we
have now obtained a better understanding of the return structure and
volatility of the indexes/sectors in question. Thus, we are now able to
proceed to the multivariate volatility analysis using the DCC-GARCH
model. However, Before I fit any GARCH models to my data I need evaluate
the presence of any ARCH effects. If there are no ARCH effects present,
it does not make sense to run any GARCH models for this volatility
analysis. To test for ARCH effects I perform the McLeod-Li test. This
test checks for auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) in
the time series data (\protect\hyperlink{ref-wang2005testing}{Wang, Van
Gelder, Vrijling \& Ma, 2005}). If present the p-values will be very
close to 0, indicating that the volatility within the variables changes
over time. Thus, it is viable to use GARCH models. This test is done in
the next section.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{DCC_GARCH_22582053_files/figure-latex/Figure2-1}

\caption{Distribution of Returns \label{Figure2}}\label{fig:Figure2}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{testing-for-arch-effects}{%
\subsection{Testing for ARCH Effects}\label{testing-for-arch-effects}}

The results in table 2.1 below provide evidence of ARCH effects. All
p-values are close to zero which indicates that there is statistical
significance indicating that the volatility between the variables change
over time. Thus, it is viable to make use of a GARCH model to conduct
the volatility analysis.

In the next section I will make use of the DCC-GARCH model to plot the
Dynamic Conditional Correlation plots and report the results.
